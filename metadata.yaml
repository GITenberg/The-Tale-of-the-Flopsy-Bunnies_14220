description: "The Tale of The Flopsy Bunnies is a children's book written and illustrated\
  \ by Beatrix Potter, and first published by Frederick Warne & Co. in July 1909.\
  \ After two full-length tales about rabbits, Potter had grown weary of the subject\
  \ and was reluctant to write another. She realized however that children most enjoyed\
  \ her rabbit stories and pictures, and so reached back to characters and plot elements\
  \ from The Tale of Peter Rabbit (1902) and The Tale of Benjamin Bunny (1904) to\
  \ create The Flopsy Bunnies. A semi-formal garden of archways and flowerbeds in\
  \ Wales at the home of her uncle and aunt became the background for the illustrations.\n\
  In The Flopsy Bunnies, Benjamin Bunny and his cousin Flopsy are the parents of six\
  \ young rabbits called simply The Flopsy Bunnies. The story concerns how the Flopsy\
  \ Bunnies, while raiding a rubbish heap of rotting vegetables, fall asleep and are\
  \ captured by Mr. McGregor who places them in a sack. While McGregor is distracted,\
  \ the six are freed by Thomasina Tittlemouse, a woodmouse, and the sack filled with\
  \ rotten vegetables by Benjamin and Flopsy. At home, Mr. McGregor proudly presents\
  \ the sack to his wife, but receives a sharp scolding when she discovers its actual\
  \ content.\nModern critical commentary varies. One critic points out that the faces\
  \ of the rabbits are expressionless while another argues that the cock of an ear\
  \ or the position of a tail conveys what the faces lack. One critic believes the\
  \ tale lacks the vitality of The Tale of Peter Rabbit which sprang from a picture\
  \ and story letter to a child. Most agree though that the depictions of the garden\
  \ are exquisite and some of the finest illustrations Potter created.\n From Wikipedia\
